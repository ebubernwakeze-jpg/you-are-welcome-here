  <!-- LEADERSHIP STORY -->
  <section id="leadership">
    <h2>My Leadership Story</h2>
   <p>
Leadership, for me, has always meant creating space for others.
As Head Girl at my secondary school, I served as a bridge between
students and the school administration: listening to concerns,
advocating for change, and helping build a culture where student
voices were respected.
<br><br>
This role taught me responsibility beyond authority: the importance
of empathy, communication, and accountability in guiding a diverse
community.

  <!-- INTERCULTURAL LEADERSHIP -->
  <section id="intercultural">
    <h2>Intercultural Leadership</h2>
    <p>
My leadership perspective expanded through my involvement with the
AISEN Student-Led Sustainable Development Goals Conference.
Collaborating with students from different schools and backgrounds,
I worked on initiatives addressing global challenges such as access
to education, gender equality, and child protection.
<br><br>
Engaging with diverse perspectives taught me that meaningful
leadership requires openness, cultural awareness, and a willingness
to learn from others before offering solutions.

<!-- LEADERSHIP INTERESTS & INITIATIVE -->
<section id="initiative">
  <h2>Leadership Interests & Initiative</h2>

  <p>
    My leadership is driven by a deep interest in addressing inequality,
    discrimination, and the limitations placed on people’s dreams due to
    background or circumstance. I am most fulfilled when leadership becomes
    an act of service: advocating, organizing, mentoring, and solving problems
    in ways that help others move forward, whether or not recognition follows.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Head Girl, I learned that leadership often begins by noticing gaps.
    When academic performance in the boarding house declined due to
    distractions during prep hours, I proposed and helped implement an open
    seating arrangement that allowed for better monitoring and guidance,
    restoring focus and accountability. In another instance, recognizing
    strained communication between boarding students and staff, I
    co-initiated a Children’s Day celebration that brought both groups
    together, strengthening collaboration and trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach to leadership is grounded in initiative and responsibility.
    During that same event, when a misunderstanding over food contributions
    escalated, I stepped in as a mediator and personally contributed
    resources to resolve the conflict, prioritizing unity over division.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through experiences like AISEN, my understanding of leadership expanded
    beyond titles. Engaging with students from different socioeconomic and
    educational backgrounds challenged my assumptions and showed me that
    leadership exists in lived experience, resilience, and perspective.
    I learned to listen first, to lead with humility, and to value diverse
    voices as essential to meaningful progress.

  <!-- STONY BROOK -->
  <section id="stonybrook">
    <h2>At Stony Brook University</h2>
   <p>
At Stony Brook University, I hope to apply my leadership skills and intercultural learning within advocacy groups, leadership councils, and engineering teams. I aim to contribute to initiatives that amplify student voices, foster inclusion, and use problem-solving as a tool for collective growth. I want to help create spaces where students feel heard, respected, and empowered to lead; regardless of background or title.
<br><br>
As a prospective Mechanical Engineering student, I am drawn to
problem-solving that considers both systems and people. I look
forward to contributing to a campus culture where diverse voices
are welcomed, supported, and empowered to thrive.
